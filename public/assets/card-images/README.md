# Card Images Directory

This directory stores card cover images that will be uploaded to Yoto and displayed as card artwork.

## Usage

1. Place your custom card image in this directory (e.g., `f1-card-cover.jpg`)
2. The image will be automatically uploaded to Yoto when creating/updating your card
3. Yoto will automatically resize and optimize your image with the `autoconvert` parameter

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPEG, PNG, or other common image formats
- **Size**: Any size (Yoto will automatically resize)
- **Recommended**: Square images work best for card covers
- **File name**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `f1-card-cover.jpg`, `formula1.png`)

## Current Images

- `countdown-to-f1-card.png` - Default F1 card cover (replace with your own image using this filename)
