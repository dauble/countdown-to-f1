## 🎯 How Auto-Update Works

The first time you generate a card, the app:

- Creates a new playlist in your Yoto library
- Stores the card ID locally
- Returns the playlist information

On subsequent generations:

- Updates the **same** card with new race information
- No duplicate cards created
- Your MYO card automatically gets the latest data!

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Authentication**: Yoto OAuth 2.0
- **Data Sources**:
  - OpenF1 API for race data
  - ipapi.co for timezone detection
- **TTS**: Yoto Labs API with ElevenLabs
- **Storage**: Configstore for local token/card storage
- **Styling**: CSS Modules

## �🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" error

- You must click "🔐 Connect with Yoto" before using any features
- If you see the login button, your session has expired - click it to re-authenticate
- Check that your OAuth credentials are correct in `.env`
- Make sure your Yoto app has both redirect URIs configured:
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` (local)
  - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback` (production)

### Can't see the login button

- Click "Logout" in the footer to clear your session
- Alternatively, visit `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout`
- Refresh the page and the login button should appear

### Card not updating

- Watch the real-time status indicator - it shows: Queued → Processing → Completed
- TTS processing typically takes 10-30 seconds
- When status shows "✅ Completed", your card is ready in your Yoto library
- Check your Yoto library in the app

### Cover image not appearing

- Ensure image is named `countdown-to-f1-card.png` in `public/assets/card-images/`
- Supported formats: PNG or JPG
- Check console logs for upload confirmation

### MYO audio upload fails

- Ensure audio file is in a supported format (MP3, M4A, WAV)
- File size should be under 100MB
- Wait for transcoding to complete (usually 15-60 seconds)
- Check that you're authenticated with Yoto

### Race time showing wrong timezone

- The app auto-detects timezone from your IP
- If running locally, it may default to your server's timezone

### OAuth redirect issues on deployed app

- The app automatically detects the correct URL using request headers
- No configuration needed - works on Fly.io, Vercel, and other platforms
- If issues persist, check your Yoto app redirect URI matches your domain
